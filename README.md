# Sistema Spinner
This is a horizontal spool spinner designed to fit a standard 1kg spool inside a sealed Vegetable Steamer box from Sistema Plastics.

## Features

This is designed to hold a spool of filament while printing, in a sealed box keeping the filament away from moisture while you print.

It is designed to be used horizontally, and in theory can be stacked.

The center of the spool holder is 50mm in diameter, but it's modular so larger/smaller spool centers can be made.

The spool center is also ventilated, and inside it you can put a bag of desiccant to keep the filament dry inside the box.

## Parts List

It's made from a few components:

* A Sistema 3.2L Large Steamer box model 1103: 
  * Manufacturer's site: [Sistema 3.2L Large Steamer Box (#1103)](https://www.sistemaplastics.com/us/3-2l-large-steamer)
  * This version is the one with the wider snap latches, you may see some older models with narrower snap latches.
  * Price varies from $20 to $37+ depending on source - I got mine from this same Amazon link for $15:
  * $37: Amazon: [Sistema Microwave Steamer](https://www.amazon.com/Sistema-Microwave-Collection-Steamer-Large/dp/B005D6XZ4O)
  * I'm not sure if this item is being discontinued or not, the price has jumped a lot since I bought it.
* 8mm Ball Bearings, 9 in total, pick one:
  * [uxcell 8mm Bearing Balls 304 Stainless, 25pcs](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YKNZJP5)
  * [uxcell 8mm Bearing Balls Carbon Steel, 100pcs](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Carbon-Bearing-Precision-100pcs/dp/B07T351PBS)
  * Only difference is stainless is a 25 pack, carbon is a 100 pack, and the carbon is magnetic. Magnets aren't required here.
* [uxcell 4mm rubber grommets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08263J3XJ)
* PTFE Feeder tube of your choice, I recommend 4mm OD 3mm ID. A larger inside dimension is better.
  * [10ft 3mm ID, 4mm OD PTFE](https://www.amazon.com/PTFE-Teflon-tubing-10ft-Allen/dp/B07B8CK8L9)
  * [25ft 3mm ID, 4mm OD PTFE](https://www.amazon.com/PTFE-Teflon-tubing-10ft-Allen/dp/B07B8CT1YH?th=1)
* Rechargable Desiccant Beads:
  * [2lb Orange Desiccant Beads](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01I5Y2DG6)
  * [2lb Blue Silica Gel Beads](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QFJQQ7Q)
  * I'm not sure if there's any difference other than the color.
  * You can also use molecular sieve 3a/4a beads, but they require a much higher temperature to recharge.
* Canvas/Muslin bags for the desiccant:
  * [2"x3" Muslin Bags](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078FW91MS)
  * You want canvas/muslin bags because they're made of natural fabric, they're breathable, and you can throw the entire bag into a dehydrator. You can't do that with plastic mesh bags.

### Hardware:
* Some M3 x 8mm, SHCS or BHCS.
* Some M3 heat set inserts, Voron Standard M3 5x4mm.
